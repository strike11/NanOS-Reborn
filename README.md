# NanOS - Reborn
Hello!

Welcome to the NanOS project repository - an operating system written in C#. This is a re-imagining of the old version of NanOS, which was developed some time ago.

Our goal is to create a lightweight, fast, and efficient operating system for personal computers.

In this repository, you will find the source code for our operating system, as well as instructions for installation and usage. We would also be glad to receive your feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to contact us through the "Issues" section.

**Thank you for your interest in the NanOS project! We hope that our operating system will be useful and interesting to you.**
